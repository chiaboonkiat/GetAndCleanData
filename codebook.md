.How data was merged?    
Data was read from files in the UCI HAR Dataset
Subject values were read from subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt
Activity labels were read from activity_labels.txt
Feature labels were read from features.txt
The feature labels were applied on the column names for data read from X_test.txt and X_train.txt
Data were read from folders "test" and "train" using function readData.
The 2 data frames were combined by rows using rbind.

.How data was extracted from merged data?
Function extractData was applied on mergedData.
Columns with names containing "Subject", "Activity", "std()" or "mean()" were extracted to a new data frame called dataExtracted.

.How descriptive variable names were applied on dataExtracted?
Function relabelColumnNames was applied on dataExtracted to:
1. change "fBodyBody" and "fBodyBody" to "frequencyBody"
2. change "tBody" to "timeBody"
3. change "tGravity" to "timeGravity"
4. remove "()"

.How average value was derived from measurements in dataRelabeled?
Function generateMean was applied on dataRelabeled to calculate the mean values for 
each subject doing an activity.
